# ARABIC SENTENCE CONSTRUCTOR
A chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating a target English sentence into Arabic. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer, only guidance.


## AI-Tools Used
ChatGPT
Mistral AI

## Prompts
The prompt format is similar to that taught in the course, however, more detail has been added to get better outputs.
The final prompt is similar in each AI tool because as i went through each tool, i tried to encorporate as much information and guidance as i could. Whenever a tool presented a problem, i fixed it and copied the prompt across all the other tool. As both ChatGPT and Meta AI dont have any specific prompting instructions, t
By giving the final prompt, both the AIs are capable of:
- Providing the answer in the desired format while keeping in mind all the restrictions and instructions provided.
- Continue to do so in follow-up prompts and give answers within the confinement of the provided restrictions/instructions.


## Limitations
For solving this task, i used the free version of all softwares and tols as i did not have the paid versions.
The reason i didnt go for claude is because i dont have the paid version and claude free version is very limited.
For similar reasons, i have not generated many xml files as i wont be having the facility of uploading many files.
